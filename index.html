                    <li><strong>Draw</strong> one card (from discard pile or draw pile)</li>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>Setup</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Select the appropriate number of suits based on player count (see table above)</li>
                    <li>Players agree on who will deal first. After each round, the dealer rotates to the left</li>
                    <li>The dealer shuffles and deals each player two separate piles of 5 cards each</li>
                    <li>Place one card face-up to start the discard pile</li>
                    <li>Each player chooses one pile to place face-down in a line (left to right) as their <strong>field</strong>, and keeps the other pile as their <strong>hand</strong></li>
                    <li>Each player rolls their die and places it to the left of their field cards</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>Understanding the Field & Die</h3>
                <p>The five face-down cards in your field serve two important purposes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A reserve of cards to exchange with your hand</li>
                    <li>A mechanism to trigger the end of the round</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Field Card Values</h4>
                <p>Your die roll determines the value of your field cards from left to right. Each position represents a sequential card value.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> If you roll a 3, your field positions are valued: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 (left to right).</p>
                
                <h4>How to Exchange Field Cards</h4>
                <p>On your turn, you may optionally exchange one card from your hand with a face-down field card, but only if:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You hold a card that matches that position's value</li>
                    <li>The field card at that position is still face-down</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> With a field valued 1-2-3-4-5, if you hold a card with value 5 and the 5th position is face-down, you may place your 5 face-up in that position and take the face-down card into your hand.</p>
                
                <h4>Ending the Round</h4>
                <p>When any player exchanges their fifth and final field card (all five positions now face-up and in correct order), each other player takes one more turn, then the round ends and scoring begins.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>How to Play</h3>
                <p>The player to the left of the dealer goes first. Play continues clockwise.</p>
                
                <h4>Turn Sequence</h4>
                <p>On each turn, you must perform these actions in order:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Draw:</strong> Take the top card from either the discard pile or the draw pile (required)</li>
                    <li><strong>Exchange:</strong> Optionally exchange one card from your hand with a face-down field card (if you have a matching value)</li>
                    <li><strong>Discard:</strong> Place one card from your hand face-up onto the discard pile (required)</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> Your hand always contains exactly 5 cards at the start and end of each turn.</p>
                
                <h4>When the Draw Pile Runs Out</h4>
                <p>If the draw pile becomes completely depleted during any player's turn, that player completes their turn and the round ends immediately.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>Scoring</h3>
                <p>At the end of each round, all players reveal their hands. Only the cards in your hand count for scoring—field cards do not count.</p>
                
                <h4>Sets and Runs</h4>
                <p>Cards that form valid sets or runs score <strong>0 points</strong>. All other cards score their face value.</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Set:</strong> Three or more cards of the same rank (suits don't matter)<br>
                    <em>Example: 7 of Hearts, 7 of Clubs, 7 of Spades</em></li>
                    <li><strong>Run:</strong> Three or more consecutive cards of the same suit<br>
                    <em>Example: 4-5-6 of Diamonds</em></li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Run Wrapping Rules</h4>
                <p>Runs may wrap around the Ace boundary <strong>once</strong>:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Valid:</strong> Queen-King-Ace or Ace-2-3</li>
                    <li><strong>Invalid:</strong> Queen-King-Ace-2 (wraps twice)</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Card Point Values</h4>
                <table class="scoring-table">
                    <thead>
                        <tr>

                            <td>Face value (2-10 points)</td>

                <h3>Winning the Game</h3>
                <p>Trepenta is played for exactly <strong>five rounds</strong>. After the fifth round, players add up their total score from all rounds.</p>
                <p>The player with the <strong>lowest total score wins</strong>.</p>
                <p>In the event of a tie, all tied players share the victory—there is no tie-breaking mechanism.</p>

                        <p>During setup, after the dealer deals two piles of 5 cards to each player, players may look at both piles before choosing which one becomes their field and which becomes their hand. This reduces the initial randomness and adds a strategic decision at the start of each round. Player's who choose to do this are given one point at the end of this round no matter the outcome.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Choose a field pile that minimizes unwanted high-value cards</li>
                            <li>Consider your die roll when making this decision</li>
                            <li>Makes the game slightly more skill-based and less luck-dependent</li>
                            <li>Players who choose to do this are awarded one point at the end of the round regardless of outcome</li>

                            <dd>After all cards are dealt and before you roll your die. Look at both piles, then choose which is your field.</dd>
                            
                            <dt>Do I place the field cards face-down after looking?</dt>
                            <dd>Yes, once you've chosen your field pile, place those cards face-down in a line as normal.</dd>

            <h2>Standard Deck Adaptation</h2>
            <p class="section-intro">Don't have an eight-suit Trepenta deck? You can play with a standard 52-card deck using these adaptations.</p>
            
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Using a Standard 52-Card Deck</h3>
                <p>Trepenta can be adapted to work with a standard deck of playing cards. The core mechanics remain the same, with a few adjustments:</p>
                
                <h4>Player Count Adjustments</h4>
                <p>With a standard 52-card deck (4 suits), the game works best for <strong>2-3 players</strong>:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>2 players:</strong> Use all 4 suits (52 cards) - same as standard Trepenta</li>
                    <li><strong>3 players:</strong> Remove one suit entirely, use 3 suits (39 cards)</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Alternative for 4+ Players</h4>
                <p>For 4 or more players, you'll need <strong>two standard decks</strong>:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>4 players:</strong> Use 6 suits from two decks (78 cards) - remove 2 suits entirely</li>
                    <li><strong>5 players:</strong> Use 7 suits from two decks (91 cards) - remove 1 suit entirely</li>
                    <li><strong>6 players:</strong> Use all 8 suits from two decks (104 cards)</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em>Note: When using two decks, keep all cards from a suit together. You'll have duplicates of the same cards, which is fine for gameplay.</em></p>
                
                <h4>Gameplay Remains the Same</h4>
                <p>All other rules—field mechanics, die rolls, sets, runs, and scoring—work exactly as described in the core rules. The only difference is the deck composition.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Why an Eight-Suit Deck?</h3>
                <p>The eight-suit Trepenta deck was designed to provide:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Flexible player scaling:</strong> Optimal gameplay for any group size from 2-6 players</li>
                    <li><strong>Better run formation:</strong> More suit options increase strategic depth for building runs</li>
                    <li><strong>Unique identity:</strong> A distinctive deck that sets Trepenta apart</li>
                </ul>
                <p>While the standard deck adaptation works well, the full eight-suit experience offers the complete Trepenta design as intended.</p>

            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>This documentation is maintained to help players learn and enjoy Trepenta. Whether you're new to the game or an experienced player looking to try new variations, you'll find everything you need here.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>The name <strong>Trepenta</strong> comes from the game's fundamental structure: <em>Tre</em> (three) + <em>penta</em> (five). The game revolves around three key mechanics that each use the number five: five cards in your field, five cards in your hand, and five rounds per game.</p>
