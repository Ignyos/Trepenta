# Trepents documentation site

This site is exclusively intended for documentation on how to play the card game Trepenta

There will be a base level game; the core game.

There will be multiple suggested "house rules" that should not in any way conflict with each other. Meaning, a group of players may select only the core game, or any combination or quantity of house rules and enjoy the game.

## Core Rules

- 1 to 6 players
- A standard Trepenta deck includes eight suits of 13 cards and six standard six sided die.
- For two players, use 4 suits of your choice. For each additional player add one more suits. Six players would then use the full eight suit deck. Each player recieves one of the die. E.G. 2 players = 52 cards, 3 players = 65, 4 players = 78 etc.
- At the start of play, the dealer deals each player two piles of five cards then flips one card to begin the discard pile. Each player then selects one of the piles to distribute on their field and one to use as their hand. They place the cards in the field face down in a line from left to right. They also then roll their die and place it to the left of their field cards.
- The field cards and the die.
  - The cards in each players respective field have two purposes: a reserve of cards to exchange, and a method to end the round.
  - Each player rolls their die at the begining of each round after the field cards have been distributed. It is then placed to the left of the field cards. The value of the die is then used to determine the lowest value of the field cards. The field cards are then considered to value that low value through to five greater than that value. E.G. die value of 3. The cards in the player's field would be 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 (still face down)
  - How to use the field cards. On a player's turn they may but are not required to exchange one of the cards in their hand with one of the face down cards in their field. If they are holding a card of the value of one of the face down cards, they may exchange the card in their hand with that card in the field. E.G. Player has a field of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and the five place is still face down. If they are holding a card with the value of 5, they may place the card in their hand face up in the place of the face down card at that position and pick up the previously face down card in their hand. Only cards that are face down in the field may be exchanged.
  - When any player exchanges the fifth card in their field (now all face up in the correct order) the rest of the players take one more turn and the round ends.
  - A player's turn starts by selecting the top most card from either the discard pile or the draw pile; this is required. Next they optionally exchange one of the cards in their hand with one of the face down cards in their field. To end their turn they are required to discard a card from their hand to the discard pile, face up.
  - If the draw pile is completely depleted on any given player's turn, the round is ended at the end of that player's turn.
  - The game is played with exactly five rounds. At the end of the fifth round, the score is tallied and the winner is the player with the fewest points. There is no tie breaking logic.
  - Score is kept based on the contents of any given player's hand at the end of a round. Cards in the players had either count against them (+points) or do not. Cards that do not accrue points are those that are in sets or runs. A set is any group of three or more cards of the same face value. A run is any group of cards of the same suit in consecutive order. E.G. a set of threes of any suit, or a run of 4, 5, 6, + of hearts.
